On system/user login, the PAM module will be invoked by the login process which will write to the /proc file,
giving the kernel the user clearance information including the 
levels and compartments.
That user information is a part of the kernel's data structure and therefore can be
accessed whenever a program is forked as a result. 
Whenever the kernel forks to access a a file, the kernel will cross reference
extended attributes with the /proc file by the and checked to make sure that 
the user's clearance level and compartments allow access.
The PAM module itself is responsible for writing the user information to the
/proc file on login.
