PAM Module for creating a sudo-proc file when the user signs in

This PAM module creates a sudo_proc file that contains user information from the 
userdb when a user signs in. The sudo_proc file is created in the directory 
specified by the dest_dir argument provided to the module.

Installation Instructions:
=============================
1) Make sure that the pam-devel package is installed on the system
2) To compile, run 
	gcc -fPIC -Wall -Werror -c pam_pamx.c
3) To create the shared object file from the object file run 
	gc -shared -o pam_pamx.so pam_pamx.o
4) You must copy the shared object file to the folder /lib64/security where all
	of the other shared object files live. To do this, run the command
	sudo cp pam_pamx.so /lib64/security
5) Edit the file located at /etc/pam.d/system-auth (you might need root privileges)
	and add the line
	auth required pam_pamx.so <path_to_users_db> <path_to_output_dir>
	above all of the other pam module implementations (to the top of the file)
6) Edit the file located at /etc/pam.d/password-auth (you might need root privileges)
	and add the line
	auth required pam_pamx.so <path_to_users_db> <path_to_output_dir>
	above all of the other pam module implementations (to the top of the file)
7) You can test with the command 
	sudo pamtester system-auth <user> authenticate
	sudo pamtester password-auth <user> authenticate
	or simply log out and log in to the system
8) Check that the new directory was created in the specified location


Example userdb file
=============================
The userdb file should be formatted as follows:
	user1:classification:level
	user2:classification:level

For example:
	alice:secret:1
	bob:unclassified:0

If a user is not found in the userdb file, they will be given level unrestricted.


Module code
=============================
See the pam_sudo_proc.c file for the module code.
