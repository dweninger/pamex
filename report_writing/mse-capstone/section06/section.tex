PAMEx performs its designed job of being a custom-built 
security policy compiler which allows for more dynamic security 
policies than the default, binary policy that SimpleFlow currently 
enforces. PAMEx gives the privileged user the opportunity to create 
full hierarchical security policies on a system complete with both 
levels and labels. Although PAMEx is presented from end-to-end as a 
working security tool suite, the lack of a custom-built kernel prevents 
it from behaving as a fully-fledged security module. Therefore, the 
tool suite as it stands was not and is not able to be incorporated 
directly into the SimpleFlow project as an automatically enforced 
security policy module. Using the Oracle tool to simulate the security 
policies created by PAMEx is an excellent way to show PAMEx working 
from end to end but does not allow PAMEx to be used in a fully-fledged 
production setting like SimpleFlow for which it was designed. In the 
future, for the PAMEx project to be incorporated into SimpleFlow or as 
a standalone Linux security policy in general, the project will need 
to have a custom kernel developed for it. With the development of a 
custom kernel, PAMEx would be able to perform several tasks that 
it currently is not able to as described in Section 3.7. 

The file labeler tool was developed to provide the ability to quickly 
change, set, or remove the PAMEx security information from a file. In 
future work, a tool could be developed to perform similar functionality 
with user security information. With the current iteration of PAMEx, if 
a privileged, administrative user wants to add, remove, or in some way 
modify a userâ€™s PAMEx security information, the administrator would 
need to start from the compilation process and work through each step 
of the PAMEx system. The development of a new user labeler tool would 
allow the administrator to skip some of the steps of the process should 
they find the need to modify the security information of system users. 

The need for PAMEx to be incorporated into and working 
alongside SimpleFlow still stands. Porting PAMEx into SimpleFlow is a 
significant undertaking and one that would need to be done only after a 
custom kernel has been developed for PAMEx. Even though SimpleFlow was 
also developed in C, PAMEx was developed 
outside of SimpleFlow. Therefore, future work will need to be done to 
ensure that PAMEx works how it is supposed to in conjunction with 
SimpleFlow.
