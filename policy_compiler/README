Title: File Security Classification Language

The purpose of the File Security Classification Language is to allow the user to define a hierarchy 
of levels as well as non-hierarchical labels that are to be easily assigned to both files and users. 

Levels
----------
Only a user with a level that is equivalent or higher to a file in the defined hierarchy may 
access that file.

Labels
-----------
In addition to levels, privilidged users may define and assign a non-hierarchical label to users and 
files. In order for a user to access a file with a particular label, the user must also have that label.
 
Makefile and Compiling Project
----------
 - Run "make" in the project file struction to compile the parser
 - TODO: "make clean"
 - TODO: "make test"

Running the Code
----------
 - Run ./parser <code_file_name> to run the code in regular mode
 - Run ./parser to run the code in test mode

Testing
----------
 - To run with pre-defined tests, compile (gcc) with -D TEST
 - TODO: "make test"

Lexer, Keywords, and Varibles
----------
Keywords:
 - level
 - label
 - set
 - file-assign
 - user-assign
 - restricted
 - unrestricted

Operations:
 - <
 - >
 - ->

Variables:
 - All variables including level, label, file, and user names must start
	with one of the following ".", "/", or an alphabetic letter, 
	followed by any combination of alpha-numeric characters, "_", "-", 
	".", or "/"


Parser, and Syntax
----------
Comments:
Comments are all in-line and the line must begin with a "#" like the following:

# This is a comment


Definition Section:

Level Definitions:
 - The first section of the File Security Classification code defines the levels and
	labels to be used later, including the ordering of the levels.
 - A level definition comes in two different forms: set and ordered
 - An ordered definition defines if a level comes before or after another label and
	a set definition has a set placement in the hierarch. Therefore, you must
	have a set definition in place before an ordered definition occurs.


Level Set Definitions:
 - A set definition looks like the following:

level <level_name> (set <unrestricted_or_restricted>);
 
 - level and set are both keywords in this instance and must be used verbatum.
 - <level_name> is a variable name that can be used later (see "Lexer, Keywords, and
	Variables" section for naming conventions).
 - "unrestricted" and "restricted" are both key words here. When using the "set" operation,
	the level must be set to one of those two placements.
 - "unrestricted" means that any user in the system may access the file with no credentials 
	necessary.
 - "restricted" is at the bottom of the placement hierarchy which means that anyone with the 
	placment of <level_name> or above may access this file.


Level Ordered Definitions:
 - Ordered definitions can be defined to place directly before or after any other defined level
 - An ordered definition looks like the following:

level <level_name> (> <prev_defined_level_name>);

OR

level <level_name> (< <prev_defined_level_name>);

 - level is again used as a keyword here.
 - <level_name> is again a variable name that can be used later (see "Lexer, Keywords, and
	Variables" section for naming conventions).
 - > is used to define a level that places directly above a predefined level. In other words,
	a user with access to this newly defined level can access it as well as the predefined
	level.
 - < is used to define a level that places directly below a predefined level. In other words,
	a user with access to this newly defined level can access it but not the predefined
	level.


Label Definitions:
 - A label is defined to be assigned to files and users later.
 - A label definition looks like the following:

label <label_name>;

 - "label" is a keyword here and must be used verbatum.
 - <label_name> is a variable name that can be used later (see "Lexer, Keywords, and
	Variables" section for naming conventions).


Assignment Section:
 - Once a level or a label is defined, it may then be assigned to a file and/or a user
 - A file may only have one level but may have multiple labels
 - A file may only be assigned a label if it has a level as well
 - A user may only have one level but may have multiple labels


File Assignments:

 - A file assignment looks like the following:

file-assign <level_name> [[<label_list>]] -> <file_name>;

 - file-assign is a keyword and must be used verbatum
 - <level_name> is the name of an already defined level
 - [<label_list>] is an optional list of labels. A file can be assigned one or more labels which
	are displayed in square brackets and delimited by ","s like the following:

[label1, label2, label3]

 - -> is an operand which means to assign the specified level and label names to a file
 - <file_name> is the path to a file in the system


User Assignments:
 - A user assignment looks like the following:

user-assign <level_name> [[<label_list>]] -> <user_name>;

 - user-assign is a keyword and must be used verbatum
 - <level_name> is the name of an already defined level
 - [<label_list>] is an optional list of labels. A user can be assigned one or more labels which
        are displayed in square brackets and delimited by ","s.

 - -> is an operand which means to assign the specified level and label names to a user
 - <user_name> is the name of a user that is in the linux system


Example File:
-------------
# This is a comment

# Define Levels and Labels #
level non-confidential (set unrestricted);
level confidential (set restricted);
level secret (> confidential);
label additional;
label more-access;
label extra-access;
level top-secret (> secret);
level extra-secret (< top-secret);

# Assign Levels and Labels to Files #
file-assign secret -> file1.txt;

file-assign confidential [more-access, extra-access] -> file2.txt

user-assign top-secret [additional] -> adam;


How the File Security Classification Language assigns levels and labels to files:
---------
 - TODO
 - Extended attributes??
