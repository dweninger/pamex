The Oracle tool for PAMEx is a program written in C that simulates how a custom kernel would cross-reference the logged-in user's credentials via the proc directory and the extended attributes to ensure that a user is allowed to access the file.

To use the tool, the user needs to enter the PID (name of the directory that the attr/current file is in) of the user they want to check for access. Then, the user can enter a command to perform a specific action. The available commands are:

    help: prints a list of available commands
    user: checks the name of the signed-in user
    userinfo: gets the name and authentication information of the signed-in user
    checkfileaccess (or cfa): checks if the currently signed-in user can access a file
    fileinfo: gets the authentication information of a file
    quit: quits the Oracle tool

The tool also requires two command-line arguments:

    dir_containing_pseudo_proc: the directory containing the pseudo proc directory that simulates the kernel proc directory
    path_to_level_db: the path to the level database that contains the security levels and labels of files and users

If any of the command-line arguments are missing, the program will exit and print a usage message.

The tool will prompt the user for input and guide the user through the process of performing the desired action. If the user input is invalid or if any errors occur during execution, an error message will be printed to stderr.
