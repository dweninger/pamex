File Labeler Usage
==================
    ./file_labeler <path_to_level_db> <path_to_file> (-al | -cl | -rl | -ac | -rc) <level_or_label_name>

  -al is the flag to add a level to the file
    If the file already has a level, this will change it to the new level specified
  -cl is the flag to change the file's level in its extended attributes. 
    This only works if the new name specified is contianed in the level DB
  -rl is the flag to remove the file's level in its extended attributes
  -ac is the flag to add a label to the file's extended attributes
  -rc is the flag to remove a label from the file's extended attributes
    If the label does not exist, this does nothing
