Welcome to PAMEx - the custom Linux security tool suite created for SimpleFlow.
PAMEx was created as a Master's of Software Engineering capstone project.
Its purpose is to be a simple, streamlined process for a priviliged administrative 
user to create a custom, flexible file security policy. The administrator can define
a hierarchical level structure of which to define the security of the files and
users as well as a non-hierarchical label structure. This is similar to and modeled
after how the United States classifies files.

PAMEx is comprised of:
 - A custom compiler made with Flex and Bison
 - A custom PAM module
 - A script to edit a file's extended attributes
 - A number of other scripts made in C

To use PAMEx, a priviliged user should create a PAMEx language file to feed into the
PAMEx parser. The outputted policy file should then be fed into the FLUDB tool. 
An environment that is set up with the PAMEx PAM module, a level database outputted
from the PAMEx parser, a user database outputted from the FLUDB tool, and extended 
attributes that the FLUDB tool wrote to the files specified by the language file should 
then be able to use Oracle to cross reference whether a user has the proper PAMEx 
security clearance to access a file.

[PAMEx language file] -> {PAMEx parser}--> [Policy output file] -> {FLUDB}--> [userdb]
                                      |--> [levedb]                      |--> [extended attrs] 

(SYSTEM WITH PAM MOD, LEVELDB, USERDB, EXT ATTRS) -> {Oracle}

Steps to using PAMEx:
1)  Set up a virtual machine with Fedora OS
2)  Clone the PAMEx Git repository onto said virtual machine
3)  Create data directory in etc (this is where leveldb and userdb will be stored)
4)  Create PAMEx language file (follow instructions in the README in the parser directory)
5)  Run the parser with the new language file and output the leveldb and policy-out files
6)  Run the FLUDB tool with the policy-out file
7)  Make PAMEx's PAM module to create a shared object file and follow the custom PAM module
     directory's README instructions
8)  Log out of the system and back in
9)  Use the Oracle tool to test your PAMEx policy
10) Optional: Update your policy with the file_labeler tool
