Welcome to PAMEx - the custom Linux security tool suite created for SimpleFlow.
PAMEx was created as a Master's of Software Engineering capstone project.
Its purpose is to be a simple, streamlined process for a priviliged administrative 
user to create a custom, flexible file security policy. The administrator can define
a hierarchical level structure of which to define the security of the files and
users as well as a non-hierarchical label structure.

To use PAMEx, a priviliged user should create a PAMEx language file to feed into the
PAMEx parser. The outputted policy file should then be fed into the FLUDB tool. 
An environment that is set up with the PAMEx PAM module, a level database outputted
from the PAMEx parser, a user database outputted from the FLUDB tool, and extended 
attributes that the FLUDB tool wrote to the files specified by the language file should 
then be able to use Oracle to cross reference whether a user has the proper PAMEx 
security clearance to access a file.

[PAMEx language file] -> {PAMEx parser}--> [Policy output file] -> {FLUDB}--> [userdb]
                                      |--> [levedb]                      |--> [extended attrs] 

(SYSTEM WITH PAM MOD, LEVELDB, USERDB, EXT ATTRS) -> {Oracle}
